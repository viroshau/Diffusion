# Project done in relation to the subject Introduction to scientific calculations
This repository contains my code for the subject TMA4320 - Introduksjon til vitenskapelige beregninger. This subject contains three main projects in addition to 6 minor exercises. These have been named according to the topic that is being simulated. The main projects are about:

1. Blind seperation of signals.
  This project requires some additional files so it is posted as a folder with the relevant files
2. Solving the schr√∂dinger equation numerically. 
3. Simulation of diffusion processes in cells.

The smaller exercises are about implementing the following alogorithms (nothe that these notebooks are written in norwegian):

1. Bisection method
2. Interpolation
3. Numerical integration
4. LU factorization including pivoting
5. Matrix iterative methods
6. Solving ODE with improved eulers method 
7. Lamberts W-function using bisection
8. Runge Kutta 4-method
9. Simple newtons method
