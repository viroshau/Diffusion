# Project done in relation to the subject "Introduction to scientific calculations"
This repository contains my code for the subject TMA4320 - Introduksjon til vitenskapelige beregninger. This subject contains three main projects in addition to 6 minor exercises. These have been named according to the topic that is being simulated. The main projects are about:

**1. Blind seperation of signals.**
  This project requires some additional files so it is posted as a folder. Note that this code requires some editing to make it work since it uses locally stored sound files that it first mixed then uses the algoriths to sort out.
**2. Solving the schr√∂dinger equation numerically. 
3. Simulation of diffusion processes in cells.**

Please note that these projects are quite large in size, so you might have to reload them a couple of times. Alternatively I'd just download them and run the projects locally if you already have jupyter notebook installed. 

The smaller exercises are about implementing the following alogorithms (nothe that these notebooks are written in norwegian):

**1. Bisection method
2. Interpolation
**3. Numerical integration
4. LU factorization including pivoting
**5. Matrix iterative methods
6. Solving ODE with improved eulers method 
**7. Lamberts W-function using bisection
8. Runge Kutta 4-method
**9. Simple newtons method**
